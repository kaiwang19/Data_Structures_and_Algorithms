===
In a B tree with huge number of elements, space requirements may become excessive. 
This is because nearly half of the elements will be empty. 
The frst variation, B* tree, discusses the space usage of large trees. 
Instead of each node containing a minimum of half of the maximum entries, the minimum is reduced to two-thirds.
